### Currently in the Foundations Track

## Who am I?

I‚Äôm an Architect fascinated by how the worlds of **sustainable technologies and
data science** can come together to reshape the ever-changing future.
Whether it‚Äôs through [architecture](https://www.archdaily.com/948970/clayton-miller-on-data-science-in-architecture-academic-and-industry-are-just-starting)
or programming or [AI driven solutions](https://www.smithgroup.com/perspectives/2024/beyond-imagery-the-application-of-ai-to-architectural-design),
my goal is simple: **make things better.**

**"How can the integration of AI-driven solutions with sustainable building
technologies redefine architectural design paradigms, enabling us to achieve
both environmental and functional optimization in the face of rapidly evolving
urban challenges?"**  
_Curious for the answers to this question? Send me an [email](mailto:ahdbasan2@gmail.com)!_

### üé® Building Narratives

For me, _creativity transcends mere sketches_‚Äîit‚Äôs about the narratives we craft.
Whether I‚Äôm designing an arcade, conceptualizing a luxurious 5-star hotel, or
addressing the digital divide, my philosophy remains consistent:  
**People first. Process second. Pixels later.**
