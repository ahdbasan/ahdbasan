## Who am I?

I’m an Architect fascinated by how the worlds of **sustainable technologies and
 data science** can come together to reshape the ever-changing future.
 Whether it’s through [architecture](https://www.archdaily.com/948970/clayton-miller-on-data-science-in-architecture-academic-and-industry-are-just-starting) or programming or [AI driven solutions](https://www.smithgroup.com/perspectives/2024/beyond-imagery-the-application-of-ai-to-architectural-design);
  my goal is simple: **make things better.**

**"How can the integration of AI-driven solutions with sustainable building
technologies redefine architectural design paradigms, enabling us to achieve
both environmental and functional optimization in the face of rapidly evolving
urban challenges?"**  
_Curious for the answers of this question? Send me an [email](mailto:ahdbasan2@gmail.com)!_

**Looking forward to Global Net Zero** 🌍🔋

### 🎨 Building Narratives

For me, _creativity transcends mere sketches_—it’s about the narratives we craft.
 Whether I’m designing an arcade,conceptualizing a luxurious 5-star hotel, or
 addressing the digital divide, my philosophy remains consistent:

**People first. Process second. Pixels later.**
> We shape our buildings; thereafter, they shape us.
>
> — Winston Churchill

### 🔍Design the Future  

Technology is reshaping everything—yes, even the blueprints!  
As we integrate AI, programming, and innovative tools into workflows, I believe:  

- 📚 Learning must be **accessible, interactive, and comprehension-first**
  especially in the _underserved communities._
- 🛠️ Programming education should focus on **understanding and problem-solving**, not just writing code.
