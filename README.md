## Who am I?
As an architect, I always thought my blueprints would stay on paper, not in code.
But here I am, diving into the world of programming, and let me tell you  I’m 
fascinated, inspired, and challenging myself in ways I never imagined.  
Also, fascinated by how the worlds of **sustainable technologies and
data science** can come together to reshape the ever-changing future.
Whether it’s through [architecture][a] or programming or [AI driven solutions][a2];
 my goal is simple: **make things better.**

**"How can the integration of AI-driven solutions with sustainable building
technologies redefine architectural design paradigms, enabling us to achieve
both environmental and functional optimization in the face of rapidly evolving
urban challenges?"**  
_Curious for the answers of this question? Send me an [email](mailto:ahdbasan2@gmail.com)!_

_**Looking forward to Global Net Zero** 🌍🔋_

### 🎨 Building Narratives

For me, _creativity transcends mere sketches_—it’s about the narratives we craft.
 Whether I’m designing an arcade,conceptualizing a luxurious 5-star hotel, or
 addressing the digital divide, my philosophy remains consistent:  
 **People first. Process second. Pixels later.**

```text
As Winston Churchil once said:
    We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.
```

### 🔍Design the Future  

Technology is reshaping everything—yes, even the blueprints!  
As we integrate AI, programming, and innovative tools into workflows, I believe:

- 📚 Learning must be **accessible, interactive, and comprehension-first**
  especially in the _underserved communities._
- 🛠️ Programming education should focus on **understanding and problem-**
  **solving**, not just writing code.
